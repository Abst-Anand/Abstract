##Complete Overview


User will select nearest parking lot around him, then we let him/her know whether there
is any vacant space available in real-time.
This would save the users' time as, now, they do not have to visit every parking lot physically.

Then the user has a choice to opt for driver who would then take the car to and from the parking lot.
Also, the user can book that particular space for any amount of time.

Basically, the users do not have to worry about parking their cars anywhere they go.

We will first collect data from each parking lot around every significant landmark.
The owner of the area will tell us how many cars he/she can accomodate.

When the user searches of available parking space near him, we will provide him/her
some options sorted according to the distance from the user.

Then he can select whichever parking lot he likes and can book for whatever time he wants.
Either he can drive his car to the area or We will have it driven away from his exact location.

We will have legal agreement with the owner regarding the security of each n every car.

The rate per hour of each parking lot in an area will be same so that users do not have
a financial barrier in choosing their place.
